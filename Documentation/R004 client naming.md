When sending a message, clients send a string that is used as their name. This name is used as an additional information when displaying messages. It is not really relevant, just makes everything more readable.

- When no name is given on the command line, then the name is the host name from which the client sends the message.
- There is a switch on the command line to set the name to anything else. See [[command line switches]].
