The server log is the place to go when you want to know what happened.

1. The server keeps a rotating file log. One file for each day.
   
2. The log files names are `yyyy-MM-dd.log` .
   
3. The log history is 14 days long. Log files older then that are automatically deleted.
   
4. The server logs all his actions (client log on, message delivery, message receiving...).
